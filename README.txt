This was a project created by Giancarlo Tomasello, Ronny Diaz, Tristian Morales, and me for
the 2018 Global Game Jam. The theme of the game jam this year was "transmission," so we 
came up with the idea of transmitting butter onto bread. 

Eventually we designed the game around the player having to cross a room with a plate of
bread in their hand in order to get the bread to a table where they could butter their bread.

The game itself is fun and silly, and has some pretty crazy physics.

I was in charge of programming the main menu functionality, parts of the UI, and collision
and spawning within the game itself. 

The game is actually quite fun to play, so if you want to try it out for yourself, you
can download the executable at:

The game is available on Windows and Mac OS. Have fun!
